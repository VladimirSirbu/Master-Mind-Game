# Master-Mind-Game
**What is Master-Mind?**

  In general , Master-Mind is a game for two players. Player one selects
four differently colored pins out of six possible colors and arranges them 
on a board in a row hidden from the other player. The other player tries
to guess the colors of the pins and their positions. On each guess, player
one guesses the number of matching colors and the pins matching both color
and position.

I developed this game in Java , so you can play alone with computer. The computer is player one, and you is player two.
When you start the game, the computer ask you how
many colors you want to generate. You can enter a number between 1 and 7 ,because generator knows just 7 colors of rainbow 
`RED` `GREEN` `YELLOW` `BLUE` `ORANGE` `INDIGO` `VIOLET`
Then, in a hidden row `n` colors are generated. After that you can guess colors. (Remark: 
enter just first upper case letter of color, no whole name of color). So after you entered your guess , press enter and 
the program show you number of colors you guess (right colors guess in not their positions) and number of colors you guess 
in their right positions. You enter guesses until you guess all colors in their correct positions.
